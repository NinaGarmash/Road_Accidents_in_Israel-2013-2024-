Road Accidents in Israel (2013–2024)  
Data:  
Over 4.6 GB of road accident data from 01.01.2013 to 31.08.2024 (Central Bureau of Statistics).  
Goal:  
Analyze seasonal trends, geographical distribution, demographic factors, and injury severity to recommend measures for reducing accident risk and severity.
Tools:  
Power Query, Power BI
Results:  
Identified yearly, monthly, weekly, and daily patterns in road accidents.  
Mapped high-risk accident locations for different vehicle types.  
Analyzed relationships between demographic factors (age, gender) and accident severity.  
Calculated fatality rates by vehicle type and their changes over time.  
Defined patterns specific to different vehicle types (e.g., electric scooters).  
Provided data-driven safety recommendations.

Methodology  
Data Sources: Three files containing accident logs, participant details, and vehicle data.  
Preprocessing: Used Power Query to clean, merge, and structure data into a single schema.  
Calculated Fields: Created fatality rate metrics and grouped vehicle types for analysis.  
Analysis Approach: Started with an overview, then drilled down into specific patterns and categories. A deep dive into electric scooter accidents was included.
